"""
This module serves as an initializer for the 'src' package, ensuring compatibility with legacy Python versions that require an explicit __init__.py file for package recognition. Its presence allows the 'src' directory to be imported as a package, facilitating modular code organization and maintainability within the IPL 2022 Data Analysis project.
